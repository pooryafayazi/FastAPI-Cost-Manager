# FastAPI-ToDo
FastAPI-Service is a compact Cost Manager API written in Python. It provides CRUD endpoints for tasks, validates data with Pydantic, and stores records using SQLAlchemy (SQLite by default, PostgreSQL-ready). The project includes a minimal, well-structured layout and a uvicorn/Docker setup for quick local runs and easy extension.
